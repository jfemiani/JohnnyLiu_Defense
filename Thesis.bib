abstract="In this paper, we describe an unsupervised learning framework to segment a scene into semantic regions and to build semantic scene models from long-term observations of moving objects in the scene. First, we introduce two novel similarity measures for comparing trajectories in far-field visual surveillance. The measures simultaneously compare the spatial distribution of trajectories and other attributes, such as velocity and object size, along the trajectories. They also provide a comparison confidence measure which indicates how well the measured image-based similarity approximates true physical similarity. We also introduce novel clustering algorithms which use both similarity and comparison confidence. Based on the proposed similarity measures and clustering methods, a framework to learn semantic scene models by trajectory analysis is developed. Trajectories are first clustered into vehicles and pedestrians, and then further grouped based on spatial and velocity distributions. Different trajectory clusters represent different activities. The geometric and statistical models of structures in the scene, such as roads, walk paths, sources and sinks, are automatically learned from the trajectory clusters. Abnormal activities are detected using the semantic scene models. The system is robust to low-level tracking errors.",

      abstract = {Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in  computer vision applications. However, there are few  algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact  superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce  a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined  five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently  generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The  simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use  -- a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels --  and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very  practical.  Experiments show that our approach produces  superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a  segmentation quality equal to or greater than four  state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall  and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the  benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing  methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already  been shown to increase performance over pixel-based  methods. },

abstract="Reliably extracting information from aerial imagery is a difficult problem with many practical applications. One specific case of this problem is the task of automatically detecting roads. This task is a difficult vision problem because of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of non-road objects. Despite 30 years of work on automatic road detection, no automatic or semi-automatic road detection system is currently on the market and no published method has been shown to work reliably on large datasets of urban imagery. We propose detecting roads using a neural network with millions of trainable weights which looks at a much larger context than was used in previous attempts at learning the task. The network is trained on massive amounts of data using a consumer GPU. We demonstrate that predictive performance can be substantially improved by initializing the feature detectors using recently developed unsupervised learning methods as well as by taking advantage of the local spatial coherence of the output labels. We show that our method works reliably on two challenging urban datasets that are an order of magnitude larger than what was used to evaluate previous approaches.",

abstract="We present a technique to extract complex suburban roofs from sets of aerial images. Because we combine 2-D edge information, photometric and chromatic attributes and 3-D information, we can deal with complex houses. Neither do we assume the roofs to be flat or rectilinear nor do we require parameterized building models. From only one image, 2-D edges and their corresponding attributes and relations are extracted. Using a segment stereo matching based on all available images, the 3-D location of these edges are computed. The 3-D segments are then grouped into planes and 2-D enclosures are extracted, thereby allowing to infer adjoining 3-D patches describing roofs of houses. To achieve this, we have developed a hierarchical procedure that effectively pools the information while keeping the combinatorics under control. Of particular importance is the tight coupling of 2-D and 3-D analysis.",
